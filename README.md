__How to tackle a Project__ with `project > requirements > plan > code" strategy`

##__STEP 1: UNDERSTAND__
- Read the __project specifications__
- __Understand the game logic:__ Write the Game Requirements (game logics & functionality)
- Write the "_problems-to-solve_" down  as small steps in a `__TODOLIST__`
- __Research:__ search resources, add them to TODOLIST

##__STEP 2: PLAN__
- Download Starterscode. 
- Open a new Pen in CodePen. OR Create a Repository in GitHub.
- Add TODOLIST in startersfiles as `-COMMENTS-`

##__STEP 3: DIVIDE__
- Solve the `_problems & subproblems_` step-by-step according to TODOLIST.
- Solve each sub-problem one-by-one (not all at once!)
- Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.
- Start with HTML & JavaScript (game logic and functionality first).
- End with CSS (leave styling untill the end.)

##__STEP 4: REVIEW__ `_Debug, Reassess, Research & Practice__`
- `Stuck:` Review and understand the given project files structure.
- `Debug:` figure out what you "really" told your program to do
- `Reassess:` Take a step back: How to solve this problem with general principles on a more global level? 
- Still stuck? `Start anew:` Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes.
- `Research:` look for solutions for the subproblems.
- `Practice`, practice, practice
